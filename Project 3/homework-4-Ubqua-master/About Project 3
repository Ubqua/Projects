Project 3 has HTML, CSS, and JavaScript document that creates a web page for purchasing Lakers playoff tickets. 
The page includes various elements such as a title, images, sections, and forms. 
The background color of the page is set to a shade of purple (RGB value: 106, 13, 247).

The page consists of three sections, each displaying an image related to the Lakers. 
The first section contains a card with an overlay image of LeBron James. 
The second section features a card with an image of the Lakers team, including LeBron James and Anthony Davis. 
The third section includes an image of the late Kobe Bryant.

Below the image sections, there is a carousel that displays information about an upcoming game between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Houston Rockets.
The details include the date, time, and location of the game.

The page also includes two forms for users to enter their personal information. 
The first form asks for the user's first name, last name, phone number, and email address. 
The second form is incomplete in the provided code. Both forms have a submit button, but it lacks the necessary code to perform any action.

It's important to note that without the associated CSS and JavaScript files, 
the full functionality and styling of the web page may not be accurately represented.
